# Steps for Creating Visualizations

## Visualization 1

This visualization illustrates the average Air Quality Index (AQI) for different countries, reflecting the level of air pollution. Higher AQI values indicate worse air quality and may negatively impact public health.

AQI values are interpreted as follows:
- **Low (0â€“50):** Good air quality.
- **High (100+):** Health risk, especially for sensitive groups.

The graph displays the average AQI values for countries during the specified period:
- **Vertical axis (y):** List of analyzed countries.
- **Horizontal axis (x):** Average AQI values.

Each bar represents a country and its average AQI. Longer bars indicate higher pollution levels. This graph allows comparison of air quality between countries and helps identify those with the highest pollution levels.

This table includes key socio-economic and environmental indicators:
- **Gross National Income (GNI):** Represents the economic level of a country, measured per capita.
- **Human Development Index (HDI):** Combines education, health, and income indicators, reflecting the quality of life.
- **Average CO2 emissions:** Indicates the emissions per capita and serves as an indicator of environmental impact.

The table enables comparisons of countries across three main categories:
1. **Economic level:** Higher GNI per capita signals wealthier economies.
2. **Quality of life:** Higher HDI indicates better access to education, healthcare, and higher living standards.
3. **Environmental impact:** Lower CO2 emissions per capita indicate a smaller ecological footprint.

The table provides an overview to help identify differences between countries in terms of economic development, living standards, and sustainability. Values in each category allow for quick comparisons and identification of the best- and worst-performing countries.

This visualization provides valuable insights into energy priorities, dependencies, and transformative trends in global energy markets.

## Visualization 4

**HDI (Human Development Index)** encompasses three key areas that together measure quality of life:
- **Health:** Evaluated by life expectancy at birth.
- **Education:** A combination of average years of schooling and expected years of schooling.
- **Living standards:** Measured using Gross National Income (GNI) per capita at purchasing power parity.

The data includes HDI values for the top 20 countries with the highest quality of life in each year. HDI combines health, education, and economic prosperity indicators to provide a comprehensive view of country development.

Key points:
- The graph tracks HDI development between **2005 and 2020** for the top 20 countries.
- Countries like **Norway, Germany, and Australia** consistently achieve high values due to sustained investments in healthcare, education, and economic growth.
- **Rising trends:** The graph highlights how quality of life in these countries has improved thanks to targeted policies and innovations in key development areas.

## Visualization 5

A **heatmap** shows the average life expectancy at birth from 2005 to 2019 for the **top 17 countries**, with colors indicating changes in life expectancy. Darker shades represent higher values, while lighter shades represent lower values.

Main points of the visualization:
- **Highest life expectancy (82+ years):** Countries like **Monaco, Japan, and Hong Kong** exhibit the highest values, suggesting not only **high-quality healthcare** but also **high living standards** and other factors like healthy lifestyles and excellent socio-economic conditions.
- **Global average:** Data shows that the global life expectancy is lower than in these top countries, reflecting **healthcare disparities**, **economic inequalities**, and environmental influences across different regions.
- **Country differences:** The heatmap clearly shows how life expectancy varies between developed and developing countries, with some advanced nations showing stable or growing values, while developing nations may exhibit lower or fluctuating values.

Commentary:
- **Improvements in some countries:** Certain countries may show positive trends in life expectancy over the observed period, likely due to improvements in healthcare, disease prevention, and living conditions.
- **Inequality:** Interesting regional differences emerge, such as sub-Saharan Africa showing lower values, correlating with challenges in health and development.

This visualization helps illustrate how socio-economic factors, healthcare accessibility, and public policies affect life expectancy and how these factors change over time across countries.

## Visualization 6

This visualization displays the maximum **AQI (Air Quality Index)** values measured in various countries. AQI is an indicator of air pollution, combining concentrations of various pollutants like fine particles (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen oxides, sulfur, and ozone. Higher AQI values indicate greater health risks due to pollution.

The graph highlights the maximum AQI values recorded in different countries, with extreme values like **China (963)** and **United Arab Emirates (868)**. These high values indicate areas with extreme pollution, which pose serious health risks for residents. These values call for urgent attention and measures to improve air quality.

Additional insights:
- **Extreme pollution:** High AQI values in some countries signal the need for significant changes in environmental policies and health protection measures.
- **Health risks:** Frequent exposure to high AQI levels can result in severe long-term health consequences, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
- **Geographical and industrial factors:** Some countries have higher AQI values due to rapid industrialization, transportation pollution, and weak emission regulations.

## Visualization 7

This **visualization** tracks the **median AQI values** in different time periods. Data includes contributions from various countries and regions, with values accumulated into a median result for each specific period.

The graph shows **air pollution trends over time**, focusing on two main components:
- **Seasonal fluctuations:** Increased pollution during winter months, often linked to the heating season and intensified emissions from households and industry.
